      <h2>What is CrossFit?</h2>
      <p>
        Researchers defined the high-intensity training program as
        <em>strength-building conditioning</em>. It incorporates functional
        movements that build stamina, strength, and speed, among several other
        areas."From an exercise perspective, CrossFit takes all aspects of
        fitness and sports, cherry-picking the best, most effective, and most
        applicable to everyday life, and combines them together," Richard
        Froning Jr., a professional CrossFit athlete, told Health.

        "We have former football players working out with people in their 70s
        and 80s and new moms" Dave Lipson, CrossFit Level Four Trainer and
        founder of an educational fitness platform called ThundrBro, told
        Health. CrossFit sessions also appeal to all different types of people.
        That is because while every WOD has suggested weights and movements,
        most CrossFit boxes promote a practice called scaling."Scaling allows
        anyone to complete the same workout simply by altering the weights and
        movements based on the athlete's ability in order to produce the same
        level of intensity"
